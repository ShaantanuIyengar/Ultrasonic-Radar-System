# Ultrasonic-Radar-System
An Arduino-based ultrasonic radar system using an HC-SR04 sensor and an SG90 servo motor, with real-time object detection and graphical visualisation on your computer via Processing. This project demonstrates the basics of interfacing sensors and motors with Arduino and serial data visualisation.
